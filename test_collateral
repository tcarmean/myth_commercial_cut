Finding the Width:

mysql> select data from recordedmarkup where chanid='1234' and starttime='2013-11-27 02:00:00' and type='30';

Finding the Height:

mysql> select data from recordedmarkup where chanid='1234' and starttime='2013-11-27 02:00:00' and type='31';

Finding the FPS (Myth takes the framerate and multiplies it by 1000. The framerate below is 59.94fps, which is legit.):

mysql> select data from recordedmarkup where chanid='1234' and starttime='2013-11-27 02:00:00' and type='32';
+-------+
| data  |
+-------+

1 row in set (0.00 sec)

Finding the Cutlist (I think we need to run the generate cutlist userjob first):

mysql> select type,mark from recordedmarkup where chanid='1234' and starttime='2013-11-27 02:00:00' and (type='0' or type='1') order by mark;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

YOU NEED TO GENERATE THE CUTLIST FIRST:

mysql> select type,mark from recordedmarkup where chanid='1234' and starttime='2013-11-27 02:00:00' and (type='0' or type='1') order by mark;
+------+-------+
| type | mark  |
+------+-------+
|    1 |     0 |
|    0 |  7006 |
|    1 | 27343 |
|    0 | 36373 |

|    0 | 69510 |
